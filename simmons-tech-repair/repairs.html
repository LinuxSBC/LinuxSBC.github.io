                A few days ago, I replaced the screen on an iPhone X. There were bright green and white lines going up the screen. If you need me to fix your device, please contact me.

                Yesterday, I replaced the screen on a Samsung Galaxy A21. Now that I have a better idea of the difficulty of repairing these devices, I will be opening up to other Samsung phones.<br><br>
                One difference between Samsung phones and iPhones is that Apple actively tries to prevent repair. For example, they use four different types of screws (pentalobe, tri-wing, standoff, and Phillips) and every screw is a different size. Using the wrong screw in the wrong hole will kill the phone. On Samsung phones, every screw is identical and all are Phillips. This is obviously much better. <br><br>
                Another way that Apple tries to prevent repairs is by pairing the serial number of parts. They permanently pair the home button (iPhone 6-8) and the front camera/earpiece/Face ID module (iPhone X-12) to the logic board. This means that, if one of those parts is damaged, nobody can replace it but Apple. You can physically replace the part but it won't work, even if it's from an identical phone. They do the same to a lesser extent for the screen and battery. If you replace the screen, you can't use True Tone, and replacing the battery will remove the battery health setting. All of this is completely unnecessary and anti-consumer.<br><br>
                The same thing happens to other industries. For example, many car companies don't provide parts to third-party repair businesses. Also, John Deere doesn't allow many parts to be replaced on their tractors.<br><br>
                If you want to help local businesses and regain control over the devices you bought, please support Right to Repair. Several states have voted for it and Illinois may put it on a ballot this year. <br><br>
                Please contact me if you need a phone or computer repaired!

                My semester is ending on Tuesday, June 1st, so I am restarting my business. Please private message me if you need a computer repaired, a phone screen replaced, or a device (laptop, desktop, tablet, phone, etc) researched and selected. In the photo below, I am replacing the hard drive of an iMac with an SSD. Thank you for your business!

                I recently replaced the screen on a Samsung Galaxy J3. The screen had completely stopped working. Although most requests that I get are for Apple devices, I still do other products as well. Let me know if you need your phone fixed.

                I recently replaced the battery on an iPhone 7. Devices like phones and laptops naturally lose battery capacity as they age. That can be fixed. Tell me if you need me to replace your device's battery.

                I repaired a Nexus 6P on which the battery was failing. The battery swelled, pushing up the screen and eventually disconnecting some parts inside the phone (see pictures). A swelling battery with pressure on it is a fire hazard. That was the main cause of the Note 7 explosions in the news a few years ago. As well as being a fire hazard, a swelling battery could cause the screen to break or allow dirt to get inside the phone. Even if the screen or back isn't coming off, batteries age by losing capacity. If your phone's screen or back is coming off or doesn't hold a charge as well as it used to, the battery probably needs to be replaced. Contact me if you need me to replace your device's battery.

                I replaced a phone's screen that had been completely shattered. There was glass dust falling out of it and turning it on would only turn on the backlight as shown in the first photo. If your phone's screen is cracked, contact me!
