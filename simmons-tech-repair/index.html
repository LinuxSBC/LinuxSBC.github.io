This website is a page for my small phone repair business. I have removed all personal information except the name of the business and my last name, which you need to access the site in the first place.

I decided to make both a dark theme and a light theme because I like when websites have a dark theme. However, since more elegant solutions like changing which CSS file you use won't stay across pages without a backend, I decided to just create two nearly identical HTML files for each page.

I also tried to follow Material Design guidelines as well as I could. The animations for buttons and tabs were too much for me, but I tried to keep the general idea and retain the depth that Material Design tries to show. This is why I added shadows to nearly everything and, in the dark theme, why I used a lighter color for "higher" elements.

Also, on pages that scroll (mainly the Previous Repairs page but also other pages on a small screen), the navigation bar hides the title but keeps the main navigation tabs and the dark/light mode switcher. This was not as hard as I expected but I'm still somewhat proud of it.

            <p>I can replace screens and batteries on mobile devices as well as troubleshooting and repairing most devices.* I can also upgrade desktops and some laptops to make them faster. I am able to build or select computers as well. If I can't figure out the problem with your device, you don't need to pay. Free estimates are available. If you want me to repair a device, please contact me.<br><br>
            * I am currently not repairing iPads and the backs of iPhones. iPads are just difficult and fragile, and Apple permanently glues the back glass to their phones. There may be other devices that I decline, but this is just a general idea.</p>
