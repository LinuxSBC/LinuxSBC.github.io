This website is a page for my small phone repair business. I have removed all personal information except the name of the business and my last name, which you need to access the site in the first place.

I decided to make both a dark theme and a light theme because I like when websites have a dark theme. However, since more elegant solutions like changing which CSS file you use won't stay across pages without a backend, I decided to just create two nearly identical HTML files for each page.

I also tried to follow Material Design guidelines as well as I could. The animations for buttons and tabs were too much for me, but I tried to keep the general idea and retain the depth that Material Design tries to show. This is why I added shadows to nearly everything and, in the dark theme, why I used a lighter color for "higher" elements.

Also, on pages that scroll (mainly the Previous Repairs page but also other pages on a small screen), the navigation bar hides the title but keeps the main navigation tabs and the dark/light mode switcher. This was not as hard as I expected but I'm still somewhat proud of it.
