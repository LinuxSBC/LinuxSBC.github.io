            <p>I can replace screens and batteries on mobile devices as well as troubleshooting and repairing most devices.* I can also upgrade desktops and some laptops to make them faster. I am able to build or select computers as well. If I can't figure out the problem with your device, you don't need to pay. Free estimates are available. If you want me to repair a device, please contact me.<br><br>
            * I am currently not repairing iPads and the backs of iPhones. iPads are just difficult and fragile, and Apple permanently glues the back glass to their phones.</p>
